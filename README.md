IT IS FREE. MODIFY THE PROGRAM IF YOU WISH TO, I HAVE NO PROBLEM.


EACH SEMESTER GPA IS CALCULATED USING THE FORMULA MENTIONED IN THE CUET UNDERGRADUATE HANDBOOK, PAGE 36-37 (http://cuet.xyz/ugHandbook2020.pdf)


COMPILATION AND RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS IN WINDOWS SYSTEM:
1. IN WINDOWS, COMPILE THE PROGRAM USING "g++ gpa_calculater.cpp"
2. IN THE SAME DIRECTORY WHERE YOU PUT THE C++ SOURCE FILE, ONE .EXE (a.exe) FILE WILL BE CREATED AFTER COMPILING
3. DOUBLE CLICK ON THE a.exe EXECUTABLE FILE TO RUN THE PROGRAM AND CALCULATE YOUR GPA


PROGRAM OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. DO NOT USE FLOAT/FRACTION NUMBER WHEN PROMPTED TO INPUT SEMESTER NO. (Ex. Use FOR L-1 T-1, INPUT 1; FOR L-2 T-2, INPUT 4)
2. DO NOT USE FLOAT/FRACTION NUMBER WHEN PROMPTED TO INPUT HOW MANY COURSES IN A SEMESTER (Ex. Use 8/ 9/ 10 etc.)
3. ALWAYS USE LOWER-CASE LETTERS WHEN PROMPTED TO INPUT LETTER GRADES (Ex. Use a+ /a /b /c /a- etc.)
4. YOU CAN USE FLOAT/FRACTION NUMER WHEN PROMPTED TO INPUT CREDIT HOUR (Ex. Use 3 /3.00 /4 /1.5 /0.75 /.75 /2 / 2.00 etc.)
5. AND THAT IS IT, ENJOY

TIP: USE YOUR HANDBOOK TO GET THE CREDIT-HOUR FOR A PARTICULAR COURSE, USE CUET STUDENT PORTAL TO GET YOUR LETTER GRADE RESULT.
